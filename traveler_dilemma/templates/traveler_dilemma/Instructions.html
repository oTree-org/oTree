<p>
You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant. Now please image the following scenario.
</p>
<p>
You and another traveler (the other participant) just returned from a remote island where both of you bought the same antiques. Unfortunately, you discovered that your airline managed to smash the antiques, as they always do. The airline manager assures you of adequate compensation. Without knowing the true value of your antiques, he offers you the following scheme. Both of you simultaneously and independently make a claim for the value of your own antique (ranging from {{Constants.min_amount}} to {{Constants.max_amount}}):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    If both claim the same amount, then this amount will be paid to both.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you claim different amounts, then the lower amount will be paid to both. Additionally, the one with lower claim will receive a reward of {{Constants.penalty}}; the one with higher claim will receive a penalty of {{Constants.reward}}.
    </li>
</ul>
