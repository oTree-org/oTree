    </h3>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>The objective is to select an option which defeats that of the opponent. Options are resolved as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Rock blunts, breaks, or crushes scissors: rock defeats scissors.</li>
        <li>Scissors cut paper: scissors defeats paper.</li>
        <li>Paper covers, sands or captures rock: paper defeats rock.</li>
    </ul>
