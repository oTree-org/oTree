The code after that comment provides that custom widget.    {% endcomment %}    <div class="form-group required">        <label class="control-label">Do you wish to accept the offer?</label>        <div class="controls">            <button name="offer_accepted" value="True" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Yes</button>            <button name="offer_accepted" value="False" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">No</button>        </div>    </div>    {% include 'ultimatum/Instructions.html' %}{% endblock %}
