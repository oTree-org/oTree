        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        Each of you will represent a firm. Both firms manufacture the same
        product.
    </p>

    <p>
        The two of you decide sequentially how many units to manufacture.
        One of you will decide first. The other will be informed of the units
        produced by the first one and then decide the units for
        herself/himself.
        You will learn the order prior to making any decision.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your choices can be any number from 0
        to {{ Constants.max_units_per_player }}.
        All produced units will be sold, but the more is produced, the lower
        the unit selling price will be.
    </p>


    <p>
        The unit selling price is:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Unit selling price = {{ Constants.total_capacity }} – Units
                produced by your firm – Units produced by the other
                firm</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Your profit is therefore:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Your profit = Unit selling price × Units produced by your
                firm</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For your convenience, these instructions will remain available to you
        on all subsequent screens of this study.
