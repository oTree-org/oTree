    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group of
        {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants.
        Each participant in the group is given {{ Constants.endowment }}.
        Each participant in the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to
        the project. Contribution could be any amount from 0 to {{ Constants.endowment }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows:
        The contributions of all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants are added up,
        the total contribution is multiplied by a factor of {{ Constants.efficiency_factor }},
        and the resulting amount is the total earnings from the project,
        which is evenly split among all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants.
        Your payoff equals your earnings from the project,
        plus the amount you did not contribute.
    </p>
