This is the familiar playground game "Matching Pennies". In this
implementation, players are randomly grouped in the beginning and then continue
to play against the same opponent for 3 rounds. Their roles alters between
rounds.<br/>
The game is preceded by one understanding question (in a real experiment, you
would often have more of these).
