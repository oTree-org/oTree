        You will be grouped randomly and anonymously with
        another {{ Constants.num_other_players }}
        participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each of you decides independently and simultaneously whether you will
        volunteer or not. If at least one of you volunteers, everyone will get
        {{ Constants.general_benefit }}. However, the volunteer(s) will
        pay {{ Constants.volunteer_cost }}. If no one
        volunteers, everyone receives nothing.
