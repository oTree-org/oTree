    <p>
        This page shows the payoffs to each participant. You do not make any money in this experiment.
        But just for fun let us pretend you did, and the currency was Japanese Yen. And suppose there
        was a base participation fee of 100 Yen. And then suppose you earned some money according to
        your answers on the form fields page.
