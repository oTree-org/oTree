Thus a transaction will take place.                To determine the transaction price, take the average of the two submitted prices, that is 0.5(3+2)=$2.5. To determine the                number of shares traded, take the smaller of the two numbers, i.e. the minimum of 2 and 3 equal 2. In this way, we determine,                ex post, that the 2 shares will be traded at a price of $2.5 per share.            </p>        {% endif %}    {% elif num_q == 2 %}    <strong>Question:</strong><br>        <p>            At the end of period 2, participant 1 has 4 shares and participant 2 has 6.
