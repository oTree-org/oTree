          <h2>Can I use oTree for free?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, oTree is licensed under the
            <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank"
              >MIT open source license</a

          <h2>Where can I ask oTree questions?</h2>

          <p>
            We have an active community on Google Groups
            <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/otree">here</a>
          </p>
          <h2>Who are the people behind oTree?</h2>

          <p>
            <a href="http://users.nber.org/~dlchen/">Daniel Chen</a>
            plays an instrumental role in recruiting
            <a href="mailto:chris@otree.org">Chris Wickens</a> for building
            oTree. Both of them have been working together since 2008 on social
            science experiments as well as various other projects. oTree can be
            used for large-scale networks, voting, macroeconomics, and mixed
            agent-based experiments. It took years of time and multiple
            grants/funds, including half a million of Daniel Chen's start-up
            fund and annual personnel research funds, to accomplish the oTree
            that we have today. oTree is aimed to be as easy to use as possible
            for students to program their own experiments. We encourage users to
            share links to their projects so that future generations of students
            can run their experiments and iterate social science forward. Chris
            Wickens is the key developer of oTree; he has worked for Daniel Chen
            full-time from 2012 to the beginning of 2017, and at various other
            points since 2008. Please send Chris experiments you would like to
            share and send Daniel any interest in teaching oTree at high
            school-level or younger.
