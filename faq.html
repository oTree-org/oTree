        <h2>Can I use oTree for free?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, oTree is licensed under the
          <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT open source license</a>
          with the added requirement of a citation of our
          <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbef.2015.12.001">paper</a>.

        <h2>Where can I ask oTree questions?</h2>

        <p>
          We have an active community on Google Groups

        <h2>Who are the people behind oTree?</h2>

        <p>
          <a href="http://users.nber.org/~dlchen/">Daniel Chen</a>
          plays an instrumental role in recruiting
          Chris Wickens for building
          oTree. Both of them have been working together since 2008 on social
          science experiments as well as various other projects. oTree can be
          used for large-scale networks, voting, macroeconomics, and mixed
          agent-based experiments. It took years of time and multiple
          grants/funds, including half a million of Daniel Chen's start-up
          fund and annual personnel research funds, to accomplish the oTree
          that we have today. oTree is aimed to be as easy to use as possible
          for students to program their own experiments. We encourage users to
          share links to their projects so that future generations of students
          can run their experiments and iterate social science forward. Chris
          Wickens is the key developer of oTree; he has worked for Daniel Chen
          full-time from 2012 to the beginning of 2017, and at various other
          points since 2008. Please send Chris experiments you would like to
          share and send Daniel any interest in teaching oTree at high
          school-level or younger.
